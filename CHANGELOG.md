# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fix the kernel.org source URL in `kernel/build-module.sh` for `x.y.0` kernel
  releases, which kernel.org names `linux-x.y.tar.xz`.
- Build, install and remove `snd-hda-codec-realtek-lib.ko` alongside the ALC298
  module when the build produces it.
- Add notes for Ubuntu-based kernels, tested on Linux Mint 22.3.

- Add `./install.sh all` to install every validated Galaxy Book 12 fix in one
  pass on CachyOS.
- Add a Pacman hook that rebuilds enabled native modules for a newly updated
  kernel with matching headers and regenerates the initramfs once.
- Allow every native builder and installer to target a kernel other than the
  currently running release, while preserving the original rollback modules
  across repeated installations.
- Keep a separate installed kernel family unmodified as a recovery option.

- Expand the project from an audio-only fix into a Galaxy Book 12 Linux
  compatibility repository.
- Add guarded AMOLED brightness control, eDP AUX discovery, a systemd service
  and suspend recovery.
- Keep the default stable brightness floor while allowing lower experimental
  levels to be tested and configured explicitly.
- Set the tested default minimum to 10 and add smooth single-level brightness
  transitions in both directions.
- Add an exact-match ALC298 speaker amplifier initializer for Samsung
  Galaxy Book 12 (`144d:c14f`).
- Add udev-triggered startup and suspend/resume restoration.
- Add guarded diagnostics, status, install, and uninstall commands.
- Add a native Realtek driver patch with automatic speaker/headphone routing.
- Use the dedicated DAC `0x03` and mixer `0x0d` headphone path.
- Add native module build, install, verification, and rollback scripts.
- Document the remaining jack insertion click.
- Add native support for the `SAM0201` Samsung K2HH accelerometer.
- Read the firmware `ROTM` mount matrix through the standard IIO interface.
- Add guarded sensor build, installation, verification, and removal scripts.
- Add the upstream Mutter session-start fix required for persistent automatic
  rotation with GNOME 50.4.

  rollback instructions.
